# `S`mall `F`unctional `L`anguage
This is a hobby project aiming to implement a small functional language.
**Goals**:
- Implement a functional language
- Typecheck using Hindley-Milner
- Have fun


## IDEAS
- Make the type checker able to annotate an AST with types / make a new AST with type info. This would be nice for IDE stuff

## TODO:
- figure out a way to test for regressions... Have some sort of folder of known to work files?
